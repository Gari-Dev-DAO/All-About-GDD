Intro To Solana (For Devs Rust/ React.js)
you can start with this article https://www.brianfriel.xyz/learning-how-to-build-on-solana/ then go for Solana cookbook & Solana playground. These are official & free Edu resources from Solana foundations & they are really good. & once you are joined ping me if there are any mid-Lvl courses you wanna buy, Chingari will sponsor it. But my advice would be at least start with documentation only https://docs.solana.com/

Extry Reads For Devs

Forward - Google announces Blockchain Node Engine!
_TLDR; It is a fully managed node-hosting service that can minimize the need for node operations._
Web3 companies who require dedicated nodes can relay txns, deploy smart contracts, & read or write blockchain data with the reliability, performance, & security.
Ethereum will be the 1st blockchain supported by the Node Engine, enabling devs to fully managed Ethereum nodes with secure blockchain access.
- Streamlined Provisioning: Manually deploying a node is a time-intensive process. Google Cloud’s Engine will make this process faster & easier by allowing devs to deploy a new node with a single operation.
- Secure Development: With the help of Virtual Private Cloud firewall, only trusted machines & users are able to communicate with client endpoints. Additionally, Cloud Armor can help protect nodes from DDoS attacks.
- Fully Managed Operations: Google Cloud actively monitors the nodes & restarts them during outages as needed.
