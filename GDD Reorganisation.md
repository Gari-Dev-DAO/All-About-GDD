# Task At Hand

1. Review & Reorganise GDD Github. Things to consider include (but not limited to):
    1. Ease to contribution: Develop detailed guidelines for contributing to any project, including information on how to submit bug reports, request features, and propose changes.
    2. Missing Documentations: is the [Readme.md](http://Readme.md) for the public Repo is sufficient for the understanding, reusing & contributing to them.
    3. Make it easy to get started: Use of friendly and welcoming tone in the documentation to communicate with potential contributors.
2. Review GDD’s Notion page & Gitbook
    1. Is the information given is clearly communicating the purpose and goals of GDD
    2. Detailed guidelines:  Are the Guidelines to onboard GDD are understandable & the language used is welcoming and inclusive
    3. Missing information to be mentioned to make Communication transparent
    4. Correct Hyperlinks: Are there any dead/wrong links?
    5. Accessibility: Do all images have alt text?
