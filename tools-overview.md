# Tools overview

We use a few different tools to drive conversation and to facilitate contributions from every member in the DAO. You'll need to use these tools to contribute to the DAO.

#### **Telegram**

Telegram invite link: Think of Telegram like our virtual office. It's where the majority of the informal discussions take place. Dive into a group, talk to others, and participate!

#### **Discord**

Discord link: Generally, the Discord forum is used to disperse information and to promote discussion that requires more formalization, like proposals for new projects.

#### **GitHub**

[**GitHub Page**](https://github.com/Gari-Dev-DAO)

As a DAO, all of the work we do is generally built as Open Source Software.Everything from project code (for projects that require development), to meeting minutes, to lists of resources is stored in repositories in GitHub.
