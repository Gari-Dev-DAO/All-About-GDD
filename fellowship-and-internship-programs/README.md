# Fellowship & Internship Programs

**Whatâ€™s the difference between Internship and the Fellowship program?**

* An Internship program would be an all hands on deck program with a lot more working freedom since you will be working with the core builder team of Chingari & Gari Network. A monthly stipend is involved, with a suitable duration concerning the Internship.
* The Fellowship program would be essentially a Web3 Product program where you earn as per your end-to-end contribution towards the development of the GDD. Payments would be attached to the project deliverables across suitable milestones. Faster shipping of products is advisable for chosen fellows, who will be chosen on a rolling basis.
