### **Want to start a new project?**

We love that you want to take initiative. **So go for it!**

Keep in mind that because it is your initiative, you'll need to **champion** the initiative and do the legwork to get things started.

Taking inspiration from Developer DAO, the following initial governance flow is proposed:

Conversations â†’ Brainstorming â†’ Proposals â†’ Consensus â†’ Execution

Some suggestions:

* Start a discussion in Discord's #new-project-pitches channel. If you need further discussion and/or validation, talk about it openly in the #ðŸ’¬-general channel, or other channels in Discord
* If you have interest and some traction, build out your idea further by posting it as a topic on the forum (Telegram) and soliciting feedback, advice, or support
* If you're able to rally the troops, build a formal proposal to pitch to the DAO. This can be posted into #Proposals Channel of the discord forum

**Apply to be a Core Contributor:** Thereâ€™s no application form per se for this. To apply as a contributor, keep heed to the following best practices

* **Prerequisites:** Complete the DAO onboarding [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdMLlDDrvl0Xg\_5s9S8nxI7gNy2QuPcPtCDkmo2tduSNSU4MQ/viewform) and reach out to the admins on our suitable channels.
